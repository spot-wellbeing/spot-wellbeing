            I feel that John has supported me and given me confidence to go out for walks which is something I had loved doing but my illness prevented. John always allows me enough time to express my mental health issues and listens to me carefully and reassures me positively. My goal was to feel more confident, manage my mental health, be happier and improve my sleep.

            Working with Holly gave me the confidence to go back outside. She took me to the opticians, we went out for walks and chatted. I have continued short walks and can do my shopping independently.

            I have no issues with Spot Wellbeing. Upfront, from the start. I don’t think I have taken a backward turn – I am going forwards all the time. It’s not ticking boxes, spot is about working together, building up a trust between your spot wellbeing support worker and the client, service user, whatever you want to call them, I prefer client. I don’t want to be a service user. Spot is personal, it is not ticking boxes and I will never be a box ticker.

            We have a client and support worker relationship, we bounce off each other, that’s never happened before. We have known each other 4 months. I had one issue, [Holly brought up healthy eating] I knew it had to be addressed. Let’s put it this way, when you brought the box of fruit and vegetables, after you went I thought ‘ah bless’ and I thought ‘you’re trying to tell me something’, and it got me thinking. I jogged me to do something.

            I have a support system now.

              Let me take you back to 2021…….I had exhausted all of my options looking for some support for a patient who was struggling with his mobility and also entering clinical depression following an unexpected bereavement. I happened to stumble across SPOT Wellbeing and my first thoughts were, “This sounds like a great service, I need to find out more”.
              <br /><br />
              I made contact and arranged a joint telephone call with all the members of SPOT Wellbeing, Holly, John and Lynn. We discussed their background in health care, their ethos and the acronym behind SPOT and I made my first referral. I have never looked back – this was two years ago now.
              <br /><br />
              I have watched SPOT Wellbeing grow from strength to strength; supporting numerous patients with both physical and mental wellbeing holistically.
              <br /><br />
              SPOT Wellbeing certainly provide the service they set out to achieve. Holly, John and Lynn all have unique and exclusive qualities, as a team they deliver with such personal care, attention and focus in time and energy with each individual patient. Their personal service is second to none and like no other, spending time to find out what really matters to each individual person, supporting and empowering them, thinking differently, unconventionally, or from a new perspective resulting in such positive outcomes.
              <br /><br />
              I referred patients into The Hawthorn Community Group community group and went along to a session so I could relay first-hand experience back to patients as I referred them to the group. The first course of six weeks worked so well the patients asked for a further six weeks. Their group participant&#39;s relationships were starting to form and they were coming together through personal experiences. They respected one another and took on individual roles but still to this day there is not a &quot;leader&quot; and they make group decisions based on everyone&#39;s thoughts, views and opinions.
              <br /><br />
              Thankfully SPOT Wellbeing were able to get some further funding which enabled the group to continue meeting. We were fast approaching the Autumn/Winter months and for some people this group was becoming a lifeline, particularly as the days were becoming longer and darker.
              <br /><br />
              The group worked well in our area, so much so the group continue to meet and participate in exercise, mindfulness and conversation, both very empowering for mental and physical wellbeing. We are receiving such wonderful feedback from patients saying they have meaning and purpose in their life, they are building on friendships, they feel they belong to a community, they have increased confidence and self-esteem and in addition they are enjoying the physical movement combined with the relaxation techniques. None of this would have been possible without Holly, John or Lynn and the support of SPOT Wellbeing.
              <br /><br />
              I have been fortunate that my practice manager has allowed me to support this group within my role as a Social Prescriber from the local GP surgery and I am able to attend the weekly group session. The collaborative working has certainly proven beneficial to patients, SPOT Wellbeing and the GP surgery for example improving mental and physical wellbeing, decreased morbidity and reduced social isolation.
              <br /><br />
              We often find it easier to recognise, engage and discuss someone&#39;s physical wellbeing rather than their emotional wellbeing. Mental Health can affect anyone and significant effect on their lives. Loneliness and isolation can also affect physical and mental health; this is where SPOT Wellbeing have really supported and empowered many patients within the group.
              <br /><br />
              I feel extremely lucky to have met Holly, John and Lynn of SPOT Wellbeing and fully support their initiative; good mental health and wellbeing are strongly correlated and I have seen amazing, miraculous and phenomenal results first hand with my patients as have the clinicians too.

            SPOT Wellbeing are a breath of fresh air. This small team make a huge positive impact to our patients and to us as a service.
            <br /><br />
            Very enthusiastic, humane, person centered, dedicated team, prompt in responding to a referral for their input, offer an array of services for all our whether organic or functional mental health issues, from physical health safety, optimization, one to one input to help build confidence, graded exposure work, helping dementia patients during the sundowning behavior with modelling of what care would help support the patient and caregiver confidence to the carer by demonstrating the benefit of care and input to help identify physiotherapy, orthotics needs so patients get the right help to enable their mobility and independence. They are also a very flexible and open to innovative working.
            <br /><br />
            One example of what SPOT Wellbeing have done for my patient: As part of Discharge planning and smoother transition back to primary care: SPOT have given hope and rehabilitated this person living with posterior cortical atrophy (a rare type of Alzheimer’s Dementia) the ability to reconnect with their passion of music, singing and dancing, when this did not seem would be possible, they have provided a new lease of life!

            Lynn, Holly and John were so lovely and supportive. I felt very comfortable at all times. It was really nice to also have the ability to talk about and get specific advice on issues rather than go to the GP.

            I now take exercise when time allows and am trying very hard to take more time for myself. The breathing exercises and being used to relax before getting to sleep.

            Exercises were very useful as they targeted important muscles to maintain independence.
